# Important Update Regarding Our Operations in China

## Notice of Business Suspension

Due to unforeseeable and unchangeable circumstances, we regret to inform you that we have to cease all business operations in China effective immediately. This decision was not made lightly, and we understand the impact it may have on our customers and partners in the region.

While our business operations in China are concluding, our engagement with our global community remains strong and active. We will continue to update our YouTube channel regularly, providing you with the latest content and insights into our projects and endeavors.

Additionally, our presence on X (formerly known as Twitter) will remain active, where we will keep sharing updates, engaging with our community, and responding to your feedback and queries.
